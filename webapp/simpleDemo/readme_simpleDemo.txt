These instructions assume you have some kind of LAMP stack (EasyPHP, XAMPP, etc)

Here are the steps to set this up:

1. Set your environment constants (db info, url info, etc) in app_cfg.php

2. Rename _index.php ... remove the '_' symbol. Verify the redirect path there goes to the REST call you want as default
