PENDING

1. Add global HOME_DIR constant

2. Thoroughly finish the /walk_auth demo for models: user, post

3. Make the relative include paths easy to configure (as opposed to hardcoded ../../../ .. etc)

4. Make the rest path prefix configurable


DONE

Sep 3, 2013: 
- /post model now uses dForm and supports INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, & VIEW ALL
- Path config is done for web client (via Smarty token)
