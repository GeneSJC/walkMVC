walkMVC: Model-Centric PHP MVC Stack
=======

Introduction
----------

This is a PHP MVC stack that is based on two core principles:

A) Build the stack using proven open source frameworks to streamline heavy lifting.  walkMVC is organized around phpDataMapper, Smarty, slimFramework, and jquery.dformâ€Ž.  The big advantage here is that when you move to the next project that uses a different framework, there's a good chance you will get to use at least some of the components you worked with here. 

B) Build all components in a "model-centric" way

The majority of the work in any app revolves around the model.  So in this framework, instead of grouping models and controllers separately - controllers are placed in the model folder they are most closely connected with.  Granted this approach may not work for every application, but I think for many it should do the trick.


Quick Start Checklist: 
------------------------------

1. Set the correct path information under app_<your_app>/_util/app_cfg.php - all configuration is centralized here; you shouldn't have to change any other files to get the example going.

2. Make sure the  app_<your_app>/_resources/ folder is writable (chmod -R 777 * is ok for development)

3. Look at the app project under : walkMVC/tree/master/app_simpleDemo

4. In that folder, the main file is : access.php

From there, you can follow the trail of PHP file-include calls (aka "require_once")



Main Concepts to Understand Structure and Patterns: 
----------


*Server-Side MVC Structure*

Each of the top-level folders (excluding folders that start with '_') in the web app project folder - simpleDemo in this case, represent the elements of a model.  Specifically, this entails the following file naming conventions:
* map_ : Uses the phpDataMapper ORM to define table fields
* form_ : Configuration file to render HTML form of model, using jquery dform
* logic_ : Application logic specific to the model
* rest_ : The controller logic that maps urls to logic.  This is really where everything begins in terms of client/server communication.  See index.html to determine the default REST path when calling the web app root


*Client-Side MVC Structure (aka, The View Layer)*

From the app root folder, notice there is a folder /_templates .  That is where the Smarty .tpl template files are placed.


Design Patterns
----------
This structure uses the following patterns to help make navigating the code as easy as possible:

* define the model data in PHP for both the database and HTML forms

* use a centralized dispatcher with slimPHP
 * Here we have an .htaccess file that allows to take the file abc.php and make the root of the path /abc (without mention of PHP)

* instead of dividing/grouping the code across M-V-C, we group controllers and models in the same model folder

* in each model folder, we use the file name conventions (where Xyz is the model name): 
  * form_Xyz.php - HTML form definition for dForm. Also, use this file for mapping request params to DB model values
  * map_Xyz.php - DB model definition
  * rest_Xyz.php - REST paths to use and the associated helper function.  It handles selecting the view to render
  * logic_Xyz.php - for accessing the database



The difference here from the popular frameworks out there, is that:
* Instead of grouping all controller files/classes in the same folder and do the same for models in a separate /model folder, here we group each "controller" with the model
* Controllers often seem to mix business logic with dispatcher logic.  In walkMVC, the rest_ files reperesent true controller functionality - that is : for path x, do action y
* Actual logic beyond mapping urls to views or actions, should be placed in logic_ files
