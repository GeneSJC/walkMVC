walkMVC: Model-Centric PHP MVC Stack
=======

Quick Start
------------

To see the framework in action, you need:

1. A basic PHP/MySQL stack
2. Setup a database in MySQL with this schema: /app_simpleDemo/_resources/post_tbl.sql
3. Set the values for your local filesystem path and web path info in this file: /app_simpleDemo/_util/app_cfg.php

* define('WEB_ROOT_FILE_PATH', 			'/Library/WebServer/Documents/dev');
* define('WALKMVC_SUBDOMAIN', 			'/walkMVC/platform');
* define('WALKMVC_PLATFORM_PATH', 	WEB_ROOT_FILE_PATH . WALKMVC_SUBDOMAIN);
* define('DOMAIN', 								'http://localhost/dev');
* define('APP_SUBDOMAIN', 					'/walkMVC/app_simpleDemo');
* define('SMARTY_PATH', 	'.'); // will look for _templates folder here
* define('DB_SERVER', 	'127.0.0.1');
* define('DB_NAME', 		'walkmvc');
* define('DB_USER', 		'root');
* define('DB_PWD', 		'root');

Why "Walk" MVC?
------------
Many of the more powerful PHP frameworks in use today, can be tricky to navigate for mid-level PHP/web developers.  With WalkMVC, the idea is that if anything is not clear - a developer can quickly do a string search across the core framework directory tree, and trace logic to it's source.  

Hence, with a little patience, for any code that is not from 3rd-party tools, most mid-level developers should be able to **walk the framework** to find what they need; the idea is that everything should be within reach in a reasonable amount of time.  

Introduction
----------

This is a PHP MVC stack that is based on two core principles:

A) Build the stack using proven open source frameworks to streamline heavy lifting.  walkMVC is organized around phpDataMapper, Smarty, slimFramework, and jquery.dformâ€Ž.  The big advantage here is that when you move to the next project that uses a different framework, there's a good chance you will get to use at least some of the components you worked with here. 

B) Build all components in a "model-centric" way

The majority of the work in any app revolves around the model.  So in this framework, instead of grouping models and controllers separately - controllers are placed in the model folder they are most closely connected with.  Granted this approach may not work for every application, but I think for many it should do the trick.


Quick Start Checklist: 
------------------------------

1. Set the correct path information under app_<your_app>/_util/app_cfg.php - all configuration is centralized here; you shouldn't have to change any other files to get the example going.

2. Make sure the  app_<your_app>/_resources/ folder is writable (chmod -R 777 * is ok for development)

3. Look at the app project under : walkMVC/tree/master/app_simpleDemo

4. In that folder, the main file is : access.php

From there, you can follow the trail of PHP file-include calls (aka "require_once")



Main Concepts to Understand Structure and Patterns: 
----------


*Server-Side MVC Structure*

Each of the top-level folders (excluding folders that start with '_') in the web app project folder - simpleDemo in this case, represent the elements of a model.  Specifically, this entails the following file naming conventions:
* map_ : Uses the phpDataMapper ORM to define table fields
* form_ : Configuration file to render HTML form of model, using jquery dform
* logic_ : Application logic specific to the model
* rest_ : The controller logic that maps urls to logic.  This is really where everything begins in terms of client/server communication.  See index.html to determine the default REST path when calling the web app root


*Client-Side MVC Structure (aka, The View Layer)*

From the app root folder, notice there is a folder /_templates .  That is where the Smarty .tpl template files are placed.


Design Patterns
----------
This structure uses the following patterns to help make navigating the code as easy as possible:

* define the model data in PHP for both the database and HTML forms

* use a centralized dispatcher with slimPHP
 * Here we have an .htaccess file that allows to take the file abc.php and make the root of the path /abc (without mention of PHP)

* instead of dividing/grouping the code across M-V-C, we group controllers and models in the same model folder

* in each model folder, we use the file name conventions (where Xyz is the model name): 
  * form_Xyz.php - HTML form definition for dForm. Also, use this file for mapping request params to DB model values
  * map_Xyz.php - DB model definition
  * rest_Xyz.php - REST paths to use and the associated helper function.  It handles selecting the view to render
  * logic_Xyz.php - for accessing the database



The difference here from the popular frameworks out there, is that:
* Instead of grouping all controller files/classes in the same folder and do the same for models in a separate /model folder, here we group each "controller" with the model
* Controllers often seem to mix business logic with dispatcher logic.  In walkMVC, the rest_ files reperesent true controller functionality - that is : for path x, do action y
* Actual logic beyond mapping urls to views or actions, should be placed in logic_ files



SQL Auto Generated Timestamps with PHPdataMapper
----------
When the SQL tables are generated, this is the SQL for date/time: 
* datetime DEFAULT NULL 

My work around is to export the schema into a text file and then update that column configuration to use this instead:
*  timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

Then I re-deploy the entire schema.


Example Project2: /app_authDemo 
================================

Provides user login, register, &amp; password recover



Suggestions for Best Practice
================================

ORDER TO IMPLEMENT UI & BACKEND

1. Define the form and the DB table it will need, using FormConfig & direct mysqlAdmin

2. Be able to do save logic
        - Rest call to receive the input
        - Logic in FormCfg to extract fields
        - DbMapper impl. for DB table
        - Logic to construct and save entity
        
        
3. Be able to do list logic
        - Rest call to list view
        - Load DbMapper for model being listed
        - Get the entity list & set in smarty
        - Impl. the view logic to extract entity elements & fields
